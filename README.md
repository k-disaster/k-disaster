## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm k-disaster. I'm Python and JavaScript enthusiast. I love to build stuff with these languages.

- :hourglass: I'm currently working on to upgrade my skills in 
  - ReactJS
  - VueJS
  - GraphQL
  - Gatsby
  - Django
  - Flask
- :eyeglasses: I also started learning Dart and Flutter for cross platform developement.
- :godmode: I love to learn internals of the things and to see how things work internally like Operating Systems or Internals of Python and JS and so many other things. Curiosity makes me read and learn about these things. 
- :movie_camera: I like reading. Also, I like watching movies in my spare time with my :two_hearts:.
