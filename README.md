## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am `k-disaster`. I'm Python and JavaScript enthusiast. I love to build stuff with Python and JS...

- :hourglass: I'm currently working on to upgrade my skills in 
  - ReactJS
  - VueJS
  - GraphQL
  - Gatsby
  - Django
  - Flask
- :eyeglasses: I also started learning Dart and Flutter recently.
- :godmode: I love to learn internals of the things and to see how things work internally like Operating Systems or Internals of Python and JS and so many other things. Curiosity makes me read and learn about these things. 
- :movie_camera: I like reading. I like watching movies and TV shows and sometimes travelling with my :two_hearts:.
